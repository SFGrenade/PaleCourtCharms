I've realised there is a grand total of 0 point in writing everything myself when the wiki exists.

However,i'll link all the relevant pages and info here for convinience.

Oh yeah and note: The wiki pages i link are to the main Pale Court Mod.So,things like "Extra dialogue","Found by defeating a boss" only apply to Pale Court.Here i will say how to find the charms in my mod.
# Abyssal Bloom
A high risk-high reward charm.It increases your nail damage with masks lost,which can be buffed by Joni's Blessing,Fragile Heart and Sharp Shadow.Other charms like Lifeblood heart and core do not affect it.
When on half hp,you get 10% incresed dash and shade dash cooldown,also a 10% increase to movement speed.Stacks with Sprint-/Dash- masters.
When on 1 hp,you get 20% incresed dash and shade dash cooldown,also a 20% increase to movement speed.You also gain 75% extra nail range,which does not stack with Longnail or Mark of Pride. 

Costs 5 notches in vanilla.

Found in Abyss Workshop(place with void tendrils entry). [Abyss_09,210.2, 50.4]

# Boon of Hallownest
A spell-oriented charm,that makes your spells have different behaviour and do a whole lot more damage.Also,it makes them look pretty cool.
Having white/void spells only changes the damage output*.
*-boon wraiths spawn 2 blasts instead of 4 with shriek,but that still mostly affects just the damage output.
I'm stating this specifically because for the other 2 spells,only the damage values vary.
Purified Shade Soul: Launches daggers in a cone in front of the Knight.
Purified Abyss Shriek: Creates multiple blasts of energy above the Knight.
Purified Descending Dark: Summons multi-hit pillars when the Knight strikes the ground.

Costs 4 notches in vanilla.

Found in Fungal Wastes,at the end of piligrim's way(City Crest entrence to City of Tears). [Fungus2_21,114.8, 12.4]

# King's Honour
This charm is an upgrade to Defender's Crest.Now,instead of being stinky you will emit ~~deodorant~~ royal aura.

As a charm upgrade,this preserves all the properties of defender's crest.Like discount at leg eater,Tuk's gift and Lemm not willing to buy your relics.
When you acquire the upgrade,the damage from clouds spawned will be incresed,they will spawn more frequently,have bigger radius and will gain an abillity to spread.

If you decide to get King's Honour before Defender's Crest,picking up Honour will just grant you the upgrade,and not Crest.So,when you pick up Crest later,it will be immidiatly upgraded to Honour.
This behaviour changes only when vanilla charms AND pale court charms are in a rando pool.In that case,they will be treated as an itemchain(Like dash,kingsoul,dreamnail,etc.).

Costs 1 notch,just like Vanilla Defender's Crest.
Note: Honour inherits Crest's cost,so if you rando only Pale Court Charms and their cost,but leave vanilla costs for vanilla charms,Honour will cost 1(just like vanilla Crest).

Found in Isma's Grove,right near Isma's Tear pickup. [Waterways_13,89.1, 18.4]

# Mark of Purity
A nail-oriented charm,that changes the behaviour of your nail.Wearing Mark of Purity disables Nail Arts,and instead enables auto-swing.
As you land nail strikes,your attack speed increases.When you hit the max attack speed,you will hear a sound.
If you get hit or don't attack for too long(3.4 seconds alone and 4 seconds with Nail Master's Glory equiped),you will also hear a sound,which will notify you of losing your attack speed streak.
Mark of Purity also lowers your starting attack speed(when Mark of Purity is on you attack slower with no stacks,than you attack by default with no charms) AND lowers your nail damage by 20%,so keep that in mind.

Costs 3 notches in vanilla.

Found at Dryya's corpse in Queen's Gardens(outside of White Lady room,same room that's after Triador Lord). [Fungus3_48,49.1, 94.4]

# Vessel's Lament
This charm is based around Focus.When successfully healing,you will create an explosion,dealing 40 damage.
You can also *mark* enemies with your nail,or nail arts(no other means with *mark* an enemy).When healing,*marked* enemies will also create secondary explosions on the *marked* target's location at the moment Focus starts, dealing 30 Damage.
*Mark* lasts indefinitely until you heal or leave the room.If you cancel the heal,the *mark* will be preserved.

Using Deep Focus alongside Vessel's Lament greatly buffs it.Doubles the explosions' damages,and increases the explosion radius by 150%.
Lament has a few more charm syneries,you can read about them on wiki.

Costs 2 notches in vanilla.

Found in Grey Mourner's(Mysterious Ze'mer's) mansion(place where you get the mask shard for completing flower quest). [Room_Mansion,27, 6.4]
Small note: to pick it up,go right until the option to talk to Grey Mourner dissapears.

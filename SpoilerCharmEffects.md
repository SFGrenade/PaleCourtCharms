I've realised there is a grand total of 0 point in writing everything myself when the wiki exists.
However,i'll link all the relevant pages and info here for convinience.
# Abyssal Bloom
A high risk-high reward charm.It increases your nail damage with masks lost,which can be buffed by Joni's Blessing,Fragile Heart and Sharp Shadow.Other charms like Lifeblood heart and core do not affect it.

# Boon of Hallownest
A spell-oriented charm,that makes your spells have different behaviour and do a whole lot more damage.Also,it makes them look pretty cool.
Having white/void spells only changes the damage output*.
*-boon wraiths spawn 2 blasts instead of 4 with shriek,but that still mostly affects just the damage output.
I'm stating this specifically because for the other 2 spells,only the damage values vary.
Purified Shade Soul: Launches daggers in a cone in front of the Knight.
Purified Abyss Shriek: Creates multiple blasts of energy above the Knight.
Purified Descending Dark: Summons multi-hit pillars when the Knight strikes the ground.

Costs 4 notches in vanilla.

Found in Fungal Wastes,at the end of piligrim's way(City Crest entrence to City of Tears). [Fungus2_21,114.8, 12.4]

# Pale Court Charms
A hollow knight mod that adds charms from [Pale Court](https://github.com/PaleCourt/PaleCourt).It was made to allow for more mod compatibility than the big Pale Court has.

Pale Court Charms has a Randomizer 4 integration,with options to enable charms and rando costs.Or you can not enable the connection and charms will have default costs and placements.

Is not expected to work with other mods that add charms,or change abillities.

See [SpoilerCharmEffects.md](https://github.com/Roma-337/PaleCourtCharms/blob/main/SpoilerCharmEffects.md) to see what each charm does,it's cost and where to find it.

Hope you have fun!



Special thanks to Hollow Knight Modding Discord and the Pale Court team for helping me with code and allowing me to do this.
